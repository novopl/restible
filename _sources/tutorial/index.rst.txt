In this tutorial series we will write a simple blogging app: **restiblog**. We
will start off very simple. Each section will introduce new functionality and
present new concepts and tools available in **restible**.

By the end you should have a firm grasp of the library. There are accompanying
reference docs, but try just browsing **restible**
`source code <https://github.com/novopl/restible/tree/master/src/restible>`_.
It really is not that big of a library and it was written with focus on
readability. It should not be too hard to follow and reading through it will
give you the best insight into what is possible.
